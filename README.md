# jdk8-tour
jdk8 features tutorials and samples

I tried to collect as many as possible samples for mastering and thinking in functional style of programming.

This repository will be completed during my learning and researching on JDK 8.

some notes :

I used junit for writing test cases but it was not necessary because there aren't any services or something to test ! , just for simplicity.
